# Deliverable 1: Shaped Work

## Project description: 

We will be developing an e-commerce website tailored for artists in Canada that offers a wide range of art supplies. We are building upon a template starter web app, developed by our existing team, which serves as the foundation for this project.

## Problem:

We've identified a key opportunity to enhance the shopping experience on our e-commerce website. Currently, potential customers often face a lack of sufficient information and trust when making purchasing decisions. They rely heavily on our product descriptions and images, which may not provide the full picture. We need a solution that improves trust and aids product discovery while allowing us to gather valuable feedback from our customers.


## Appetite:

We aim to create a customer-centric e-commerce solution that not only boosts trust and confidence in our products but also fosters a seamless and engaging shopping journey. Our goal is to empower customers with rich, informative content that aids in confident decision-making, while simultaneously enabling us to collect actionable feedback to refine and enhance their shopping experience.

## Solution:

We propose implementing a "User-generated Product Reviews and Ratings" feature on our e-commerce website. This feature will empower our customers to share their experiences with the products they've purchased, offering insights that go beyond what we can provide in product descriptions. Key elements of this solution include:

- **Review Submission** : Customers who have made a purchase will be able to submit reviews and rate the products they've bought.

- **Ratings System** : Products will be rated on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, providing a quick reference for potential buyers.

- **Aggregate Ratings** : Product pages will prominently display average ratings, providing a snapshot of product quality.

## Rabbit Holes:

- Developing a robust moderation system to ensure the quality of reviews may require more effort than anticipated.
- Verification of customer purchases could be technically challenging but is crucial for maintaining review authenticity.

## Scope:

- This feature will be rolled out for all product categories on our e-commerce platform.
- Initially, we will focus on implementing the core functionality of review submission and rating display.
- Further enhancements, such as response mechanisms, incentives, sorting and filtering will be considered in subsequent cycles.
